# Predicting used car sale prices based on features

This repo contains all code used to predict car sale prices.

Steps in the project
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, EDA
- Hyper parameter tuning and model selection: Linear regression, XGBoost, Random forest, Ridge, Gradient Boosted, Kernel Ridge, Bagging, Adaptive Boost, Multiple Layer Perceptron
- Other model tests: stacking regressor, feature importance, feature selection and extraction (PCA LDA KPCA)

Method of evaluation: RMSE

Gradient Boosted model did the best on this dataset to predict car prices.
